        <h2> Adam G AKA G money </h2>
        <p> I am majoring in Computer Science
            I enjoy playing guitar, and video games 
            I am marred and have two furry children 
            I currently work at Target 
            I am pursuing a Bachelors degree 
            I like web design because I feel it is the most broad and most used dsciple of CS.
            I often use web pages more than I use apps on my phone. 
            I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was 13. 
            My favorite scripture is Alma 7:11
